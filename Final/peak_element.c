[Peak Element]: A peak element is an element that is strictly greater than its 
neighbors. Given a 0-indexed integer array nums, find a peak element, and 
return its index. If the array contains multiple peaks, return the index 
to any of the peaks. You may imagine that nums[-1] = nums[n] = -âˆž. 
In other words, an element is always considered to be strictly greater 
than a neighbor that is outside the array. 
You must write an algorithm that runs in O(log n) time.
